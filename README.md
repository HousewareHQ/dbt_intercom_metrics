# Intercom Metrics dbt Package ([Docs](https://housewarehq.github.io/dbt_intercom_metrics))

# üì£ What does this dbt package do?
This package provides pre-built metrics for Intercom data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/intercom). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/intercom#schemainformation).

This package enables you to access commonly used metrics on top of Intercom Support Tickets.

## Metrics 

This package contains transformed models built on top of [Fivetran Intercom](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_intercom) & [Intercom_source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_intercom_source). A dependency on the source packages is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. 

The metrics offered by this package are described below

| **metric**                          | **description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

# üéØ How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:
- At least one Fivetran intercom connector syncing data into your destination. 
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, or **PostgreSQL** destination.


## Step 2: Install the package

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://github.com/HousewareHQ/dbt_intercom_metrics.git"
    revision: v0.1.0
```

## Step 3: Define database and schema variables

By default, this package will look for your Intercom data in the `intercom` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Intercom data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  intercom_source:
    intercom_database: your_database_name
    intercom_schema: your_schema_name
```

For additional configurations for the source models, please visit the [Intercom source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_intercom_source).

## (Optional) Step 4: Change build schema
By default this package will build the Intercom staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_intercom`) and the Intercom metrics within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_intercom_metrics`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled Intercom data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
  intercom_metrics:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
  intercom_source:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
